                    <p class="text-muted">Furthermore, I am well-versed in working with the relationship difficulties

                        ‘doing what works’ in therapy- for anxiety disorders this usually involves exposure and facing
                        fears. However, this is always done entirely at your own pace and in a manageable way.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">I trained as a clinical psychologist at University College London before
                    completing Postgraduate Diploma in Cognitive Behavioural Therapies at the Institute of Psychiatry,
                    Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">I am registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (registration number:
                    PYL32690) and accredited by the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">In my NHS work I am based at the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma in the
                    Maudsley hospital, which is a national specialist tertiary service.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">My role is in the parental anxiety sub-team at the clinic, which has provided me
                    with a lot of experience in treating pregnant women and new parents with anxiety disorders and
                    trauma- particularly perinatal OCD and birth trauma.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">I recently worked as a therapist on a randomised clinical trial comparing standard
                    weekly treatments with intensive CBT for anxiety disorders in pregnancy, which has expanded my
                    proficiency in using exposure-based treatments in pregnancy (an area in which many clinicians lack
                    confidence) and delivering intensive treatments.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">I am a member of the BABCP perinatal special interest group and am knowledgeable
                    about the specific perinatal competencies needed to deliver treatment to women in this vulnerable
                    time.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">In addition to my clinical work, I provide supervision to trainees and qualified
                    clinicians, and deliver teaching to other NHS teams and on training courses. I have been a visiting
                    speaker at various universities and professional organisations including Kings College London,
                    Exeter University, and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.</p>

                                    <p>Dr Roxborough uses the information collected to:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Provide services to you.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Process payment for such services.</p></li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p><b> Who we might share personal information with:</b></p>
                                    <p>Information is held about each client and the therapy received in strictest confidence. This means that your personal data will not normally be shared with anyone else with the exception of a clinical supervisor (see below). There are further exceptions to this, when there may be an established need for liaison with other parties:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>If you are referred by your health insurance provider, or otherwise claiming through a health insurance policy to fund therapy, then we will share appointment schedules with that organisation for the purposes of billing. We may also share information with that organisation to provide treatment updates.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>In cases where treatment has been instructed by a solicitor, relevant clinical information from therapy records will be shared with legal services as required and with your written consent.</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In exceptional circumstances, Dr Roxborough might need to share personal information with relevant authorities:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>When there is need-to-know information for another health provider, such as your GP.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>When disclosure is in the public interest, to prevent a miscarriage of justice or where there is a legal duty, for example a Court Order.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>When the information concerns risk of harm to the client, or risk of harm to another adult or a child. We will discuss such a proposed disclosure with you unless we believe that to do so could increase the level of risk to you or to someone else.</p></li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p><b>Clinical supervision:</b></p>
                                    <p>To uphold standards of professional practice, required by regulatory bodies including the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), all registered practitioner psychologists are required to receive regular supervision from a qualified psychologist. During supervision, details only relevant to your treatment will be discussed. Clients will not be identified by name. Supervisory contacts are bound by confidentiality agreements (as above).</p>

We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

                                    <p><b>What is NOT done with your personal information:</b></p>
                                    <p>Your personal information will not be shared with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

                                    <p><b>How the security of personal information is ensured:</b></p>
                                    <p>Personal information is minimised to phone and email communication. Any sensitive personal data which needs to be sent to clients will be transmitted in an email attachment that is password protected. Email applications use private (SSL) settings, which encrypts email traffic so that it cannot be read at any point between our computing devices and our mail server. Dr Roxborough will never use open or unsecure Wi-Fi networks to send any personal data.</p>
                                    <p>Personal information is stored on a password protected computer. Malware and antivirus protection is installed on all computing devices. Mobile devices are protected with a passcode/thumbprint scanner, mobile security and antivirus software.</p>

                                    <p><b>Your right to access the personal information held about you:</b></p>

                                        <li><p>You have a right to access the information held about you.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>This will usually be shared with you within 30 days of receiving a request.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Further evidence from you may be request in order to check and verify your identity.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>A copy of requested personal information will usually be sent to you in a permanent form (that is, a printed copy).</p></li>
                                        <li><p>You have a right to have your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>If you think that data protection laws have not been complied with, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office.</p></li>

                                    <p><b>1.1 Fees</b></p>

                                    <p>Appointments are charged at the following rates:<br>
                                    Initial consultation appointment&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;£150<br>
                                    Follow-up/ongoing therapy appointment&emsp;&emsp;£150</p>

                                    <p><b>1.2 Payment (Self-funding)</b></p>
                                    <p>Payment for sessions can be made via bank transfer (details provided on each invoice).</p>
                                    <p>Payment for an initial consultation appointment must be made at the time of booking, in order for the appointment to be confirmed.</p>
                                    <p>Payment for ongoing therapy appointments must be made before or on the day of the appointment unless otherwise agreed.</p>
                                    <p>Clients are requested to use the reference number on the invoice, so that the payment can be easily identified.</p>

                                    <p><b>1.3 Payment (Private insurance)</b></p>
                                    <p>Please check in advance (by emailing aroxboroughpsychologist@gmail.com) if your specific insurance policy will be accepted.</p>
                                    <p>If you are funding sessions using private health insurance, payment by your insurer is due within 30 calendar days of the invoice date. In such cases, you are fully responsible for the costs of your treatment, so it is recommended that you have a full understanding of the level of cover your insurer will provide. Any shortfalls or excesses will need to be paid directly.</p>
                                    <p> Your insurer will provide you with an authorisation code to cover a set number of therapy sessions. This, along with your policy number, must be inputted in your Client Registration form - failure to do so will make you liable for any appointment costs. Should you require further sessions it is your responsibility to contact your insurance company to authorise further sessions.</p>

                                    <p><b>2. Cancellation policy</b></p>

                                    <p><b>2.1 Self-funded appointments:</b></p>
                                    <p>You may cancel an appointment without charge if you provide at least 48 hours in working days prior notice.&nbsp;For example, cancellations for appointments on Tuesdays should be communicated to us on Fridays at the least, to ensure a charge is not incurred. If you do so, we will refund to you any sum you paid in advance.</p>
                                    <p>Any cancellations made with fewer than 48 hours’ (in working days) notice will be charged at the full rate.</p>

                                    <p><b>2.2 Insurance-funded appointments:</b></p>
                                    <p>Where treatment is funded by private health insurance, an employer and/or as part of a legal process, cancellations with fewer than 48 hours’ notice (or failures to attend) are likely to be counted as one of your designated appointments.</p>
                                    <p>Several insurance companies do not cover the fee for sessions cancelled without at least 48 hours’ notice. In such instances, the individual will be liable to cover the cost of any sessions cancelled without at least 48 hours’ notice (as per the fee schedule listed in Section 1 of this document).</p>

                                    <p>You should check with your health insurance policy to ensure you know when they will and will not cover your costs.</p>

                                    <p><b>3. Privacy policy</b></p>
                                    <p>Your privacy is taken very seriously.
